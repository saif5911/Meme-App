The APP typically involve the following components

1.User Interface: The app would have a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to browse and view memes. 
This would typically involve designing and implementing layouts using XML and Kotlin code.

2.API Calling: If the app is fetching memes from a server, it would need to use an API to communicate with the server and retrieve the data. 
This would typically involve making HTTP requests and parsing the response using a library like Retrofit or Volley.

3.Image Processing: Once the app has retrieved a meme, it would need to process the image to display it in the app.
This could involve resizing, cropping, or applying filters to the image using a library like Glide or Picasso.

4.User Interaction: Finally, the app would need to respond to user interaction, such as when a user clicks on a meme to view it in more detail or when they share a meme on any social media platform

Overall, it is a fun and engaging platform for users to discover, share memes with a large community of like-minded individuals.
